### Build the project
We use Dune to build our projects. You can install it with `opam install dune`, and then add it to your path with the command `eval $(opam config env)`.

We can build with `dune build [file_name.exe]` and then run with `dune exec file_name.exe`.

You can learn more about Dune at [https://github.com/ocaml/dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune).
